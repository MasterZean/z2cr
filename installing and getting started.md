# Installing and getting started

This section will detail how to install Z2 ang get started with it, compiling "Hello world", other samples and writing you own first programs, using the [[pre-compiled releases](https://github.com/MasterZean/z2cr/releases)] under Windows or Linux.

If instead you wish to compile from source, a more advanced topic, see [[compiling from sources]].

## Installing under windows

The first step would be checking out the [[pre-compiled releases](https://github.com/MasterZean/z2cr/releases)] page from GitHub. 

Here you will the list of pre-compiled releases. In general, it is a good idea to take the latest release.

At the moment of writing this, this will be around 0.4. Grab the appropriate ZIP archive. If you open it up, you will find that it contains a single folder: `z2cr`.

You can copy this folder anywhere you wish on your Windows system, but the rest of this guide will assume that you installed in your root C: partition, so the install path for Z2 will be: `C:\z2cr`. 

 #### Note on release names:
> Releases have names like Z2CR 0.4.pre-alpha (Win32 x64 + Clang 18.1.5)].
> Z2CR is the name of the project and is the Z@ compiler
> 0.4.pre-alpha is the version of the compiler and it states that it is currently a pre-alpha
> Within parenthesis you will find the target version. Win32 x64means this is a binary for Windows, compiled to 64 bits.
> If within the parenthesis you find another string, like Clang 18.1.5, this means that this build comes bundled with a backend compiler. Grab one of these if you desire to compile out of the box and your system has no compatible backend compilers installed.
> 
> This release name will translate to a much simpler archived package name: z2cr-0.4-pre-alpha-win32.zip
